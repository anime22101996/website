 <h3> Indian Army </h3>
<p>
The Indian subcontinent had witnessed the cohesive concentration of many Empires in the quest for control of military power, 
and governance of the State. As time rolled by, societal norms found an ethos in the workplace, the system 
of rights and privileges, and service under the flag.
<br>
The Indian Army, as we know it today became operational after the Country gained independence 
from British colonialism. The Indian Army's HQ is located in New Delhi and functions under the
Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is responsible for the command, control, and administration 
as a whole. The Army is divided into six operational commands (field armies) and one 
training command, each under the command of a Lieutenant General, who has an equal status to
the Vice-Chief of Army Staff (VCOAS), working under the control of Army HQ in New Delhi.

<h3> Indian Navy</h3>
<p>
The foundation of the modern Indian Navy was laid in the seventeenth century when the East India 
Company had established a maritime force, thereby graduating in time to the establishment of the 
Royal Indian Navy in 1934. The Headquarters of the Indian Navy is located in New Delhi, and is under
the command of the Chief of the naval staff – an Admiral. The Indian navy is deployed under three area
commands, each headed by a flag officer. The Western Naval Command is headquartered in Bombay on the
Arabian Sea; the Southern Naval Command in Kochi (Cochin), in Kerala, also on the Arabian Sea; and 
the Eastern Naval Command in Vishakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, on the Bay of Bengal.

<h3> Indian Air Force</h3>
<p>
The Indian Air Force was officially established on 8th October 1932, and on 1st April 1954,
Air Marshal Subroto Mukherjee, one of the founding members of the Air Force took over as the
first Indian Chief of Air Staff. With the passage of time, the Indian Air Force undertook 
massive upgrading of its aircraft and equipments, and as part of the process, it introduced
more than twenty new types of aircrafts. The last decade of the twentieth century saw a 
phenomenal change in the structure of the Indian Air Force with induction of women into the
Air Force for short service commissions. It was also a time when the Air Force undertook 
some of the most perilous operations ever undertaken.
